        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <article class="intro__content">
          <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

          <p>
            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
            write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:

          <code
            ><p>
              function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <article id="variable__content">
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

      <section id="declaring">
        <h2>Declaring Variables</h2>
        <article class="declaring__content">
          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
          <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
          <code><p>var x = 42</p></code>
          <p>
            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
          <code><p>x = 42.</p></code>
          <p>
            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
            JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
          </p>
          <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
          <code><p>let y = 13.</p></code>
          <p>
            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
            Variable scope below.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="scope">
        <h2>Vatiable Scope</h2>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
          (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
          following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
          global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
          this case is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code><p>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</p> </code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>
        <code
          ><p>
            if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            defined
          </p>
        </code>
      </section>
      <section id="if">
        <h2>If..else statements</h2>
        <article class="if__content">
          <p>
            Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition
            is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
            condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
          </p>
          <code
            ><p>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</p></code
          >
          <p>
            condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
            Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
            condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
            statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
            statement, including further nested if statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
          </p>
          <code
            ><p>
              if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
              statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
              statement_last; }
            </p></code
          >
          <p>
            In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
            which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
            statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
            general, it's good practice to always use block statements,
            especially when nesting if statements:
          </p>
          <code
            ><p>
              if (condition) <br />
              { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
              statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } <br />
              else <br />{ statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
              statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
            </p></code
          >
          <p>
            It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
            expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality
            when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following
            code:
          </p>
          <code><p>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</p></code>
          <p>
            If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a
            common practice is to put additional parentheses around the
            assignment. For example:
          </p>
          <code><p>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</p></code>

      <section id="functions">
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <article class="functions__content">
          <p>
            A function definition (also called a function declaration, or
            function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
          </p>
          <ul id="functions__list">
            <li>The name of the function</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parenthesis by
              commas
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
              curly brackets, { }.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named
            square:
          </p>
          <code>
            <p>function square(number) { return number * number; }</p>
          </code>
          <p>
            The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
            consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
            function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
            statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          </p>
          <code>
            <p>return number * number;</p>
          </code>
          <p>
            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
            value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
            changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
            globally or in the calling function.
