      <p>
        Block elements stack on top each other and create new lines.inline is
        opposite. block level elements have full width if they are not inside of
        something tha is limiting their width
      </p>

      <h2>CSS FLOATS</h2>

      <p>white-space sets how white space is handled inside the element</p>
      <h2>Css Positioning</h2>
      <p>Static is the default</p>
      <p>The postion properties need a top left right bottom</p>
      <p>
        Absolute positiong needs a parent element(closest to it) position of
        relative then otherwise it takes bowser window
      </p>
      <p>Relative is always going to be relative to it's parent element</p>
      <p>fix stays in the place even on scroll</p>
      <p>Z-index makes on on top of the other</p>
      <p>sticky stays at the spot momentarly until it's container is over</p>
      <p>
        Absolute can be used to remove a element form the page eg set left to
        -10000000000px

      <h2>Css flexbox</h2>
      <p>by default flex is in a row</p>
      <p>Flex direction is row by default and can be changed to column</p>
      <p>Justify-content to space-evenly,space-between,-space-around</p>
      <p>Align items to align items to center,left,right</p>
      <p>Can do column or row reverse. flex direction</p>
      <p>Flex-wrap makes the cotent wrap when less width</p>
      <p>Align-cotent aligns the rows</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Now idividual flex items</p>
      <p>flex-bassis is essentially min width</p>
      <p>flex-grow makes the content as much width as it can</p>
      <p>flex-shrink has same concept as flex-grow but it shrinks</p>
      <p>
        Shorthand flex can be used its first value is flex-grow, seccond is
        flex-shrink and third is flex-basisi
      </p>
      <p>flex-basis can accept percentages</p>
      <p>order can be used to arrange the element from that spot</p>
      <p>Flex box froggy for practice</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Css Grid</h2>
      <p>Display grid makes grid items</p>
      <p>Fraction units are specifficaly used for css grids "fr"</p>
      <p>
        Instead of specifying every column we can use repeat("insert column",
        value for columns
      </p>
      <p>Grid can have empty space</p>
      <p>
        Grid-auto-rows/colums can have minmax value it accepts first value as
        minimum and second as max height
      </p>
      <p>It ca be column or row column-gap</p>
      <p>
        The grild-column-start and end tells how many columns it takes up which
        is based on the lines
      </p>
      <p>
        like a flexbox in which a flex item could be a flex container just like
        that a grid can also do it.(nesting a grid inside or grid item) using
        one value for place content sets it for both
      </p>
      <p>
        Grid-template-areas is used to design the grid the items need to be
        defined for it to work
        <strong>Grid-area is used to name grid items</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        grid-area accepts 4 values 1(row-start) / 2( column-start) / 3 (row-end)
        /4 (column-end)
      </p>
      <p>
        grid-template for both rows and column template. for example,
        grid-template: 50% 50% / 200px; will create a grid with two rows that
        are 50% each, and one column that is 200 pixels wide.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Css images</h2>
      <p>imgs are inline. so set img to display:block</p>
      <p>
        if width is percentage and height is auto it makes the img responsive
      </p>
      <p>you can make square imgs round not rectangle imgs by border radius</p>
      <p>
        the background img repeats along x and y axis so background repeat:no
        repeat is used
      </p>
      <p>width then height</p>
      <p>back ground postion to focus on particular part of the image</p>
      <p>
        linear gradient(also acts as background image) causes transition of one
        color to another can also be used to specify transition of the color
        from left to right and stuff remember to put comma in between
      </p>
      <p>background repeat in the sequence of linear gradient</p>
      <p>background size in the sequence of gradient</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Media queries</h2>
      <p>
        syntax: @media media type and(condition: breakpoint) { //css rules }
      </p>
      <p>
        min-width should be read as start from so whatever width is specified
        the styles would start from that width.max width means styles would
        apply upto that width
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Pseudo</h2>
      <p>
        :is can select a element that have certain conditions e.g nav
        :is(a:hover, b:focus) selects nav with anchor hover and b focus
      </p>
      <p>D.R.Y is do not repeat yourself</p>
      <p>Any-link pseudo class chooses but link and visited pseudo class</p>
      <p>:target pseudo class does things things to one that is selected</p>
      <p>
        select element and put braces around a attribute of it to target
        elements with that attribute []
      </p>
      <p>
        Redefine a variable by putting the name of var then changing the value
        in that particular element
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>Var is reference Function</p>
      <p>url is reference function used to load image</p>
      <p>
        Should provide absolute value to min max so that you know which one it
        will chooose. use vh for fonts
      </p>
      <p>
        min provides a absolute value that will act as the biggest value it can
        be
      </p>
      <p>
        max will have absolute value that will act as the smallest value it can
        be
      </p>
      <p>filter property can be used to increase brightness</p>
      <p>
        minamax for grid gives the largest a template can be and the smallest a
        template can be
      </p>
      <h2>CSS animations</h2>
      <p>
        The positive value for translate moves it to the right and the negative
        value moves it to the left
      </p>
      <p>
        Negative value for translate y moves it up while the positive value
        moves it down
      </p>
      <p>Transform origin tells where the transformation where to start</p>
      <p>
        In rotate consider it as card the top part moves away from you and
        bottom part towards you
      </p>
      <p>Rotate z rotates clockwise.Rotate z is the same as rotate</p>
      <p>Scale x causes it to grow horizontally</p>
      <p>skew makes it lean. skew x(positive) to the right and vice versa</p>
      <p>skew y postive makes it lean up and vice versa</p>
      <!-- scale,translate,skew etc can have shorthand where first value is x and secodn is y -->
      <h2>Transitions</h2>
      <p>Transition delay is just before a transition starts</p>
      <p>
        transition can be applied by giving the value to the transition-property
      </p>
      <p>linear timing - function makes it go at a even pace</p>
      <p>ease-in-out speeds up and slows down and vice verse ease is default</p>
      <h2>Css animations</h2>
      <p>animation-iteration-count makes the animation repeat</p>
      <p>
        animation direction alternate cause it to go forward first time then
        reverse the second time
      </p>
      <p>animation fill mode tells ending stage</p>
      <p>double dash indicates that it will be a modifier</p>
